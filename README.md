# numpy.random

Programming for Data Analysis

Assignment 2019 (Numpy.Random Package)

Problem Statement
This assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python. A Jupyter notebook will be created and it will be explainations on the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the numpy.random package.
The assignment has four distinct tasks to be executed within the Jupyter notebook.


Task 1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
Task 2. Explain the use of the "Simple random data" and "Permutations" functions.
Task 3. Explain the use an purpose of at least five "Distributions" functions.
Task 4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.


The assignment will be tracked the version control software git, and will also be submitted by providing a URL to the students git repository using the link on the course Moodle page.

Tools
